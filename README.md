# flutter-firebase-demo
A Flutter - Firebase Demo project. Utilizes Firestore as well as Firebase Authentication to allow multiple users to login and customize their user information. Provides the required 4 screens: Sign-in page, Registration page, Instructor page, Update User info Drop-Down page.

A simple "Hello World"-style program for instructors to gather and record their class information.

## Improvements
This project could be heavily improved through a few simple changes. For example, my particular demo would not dispaly the Coding Minds logo on the login and registration pages. Other improvements could come in custom instructor pages, more instructor info, filtering and searching of information akin to a social network.

### Ideas
The program and formatting is probably best refocused to be an application for students and professors alike to login and store their current courses. These courses could then have their own pages as well.
